## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing generative models for the AlphaDigits and MNIST datasets. The primary scripts for generating images on the AlphaDigits dataset and classification for the MNIST dataset are located at the root of the repository.

### Repository Structure

- **download:** Contains the script for downloading the MNIST & AlphaDigits datasets.
- **models:** Contains implementations of various models in classes such as Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN).

## Getting Started

To start working on the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the scripts located in the `download` folder to download the datasets.
4. Explore the models implemented in the `models` folder and modify them as needed for your experiments.
